<h2>Framework explained:</h2>

For the test case design within my TestNG framework, I have used the Page Object Model with Page Factory. 
<p>
Reason for using this in my test case design is to create specific object repositories for the Web UI elements which will help avoid duplication 
<br/>and assist with easy maintenance of the tests. 

<h2>Project Folder Structure:</h2>
<p>com.buggy.tests â€“ All tests are maintained in this folder
<p>com.buggy.pages â€“ All web elements and methods for the tests are maintained in this folder. The page names correspond to the respective tests.
